Still wasn't 6 ft, so I was annoyed, but I just got away as quickly as possible.","Laurie Lingel same.

They truly don't think they are too close","my next response would be, Get the f... away from me","Damon Cameron Ross hadn’t thought of that one  ","Laurie Lingel I have a rather large personal bubble, so you better believe I’m a good judge of physical distance. I don’t want people close to me even without covid LOL ","Damon Cameron Ross you’re so smart!","James Hayden yeah, fortunately,  being 6'2\" I can unload and load the cart back up from that position without strain. Gives me a 6' buffer between the person in front and back. I got this down.","Laurie Lingel Must be Germany; we dont care about personal space LOL","Laurie Lingel normally I'm with you, but if it's not going to get you arrested, I'd say be as rude as you need to be. \"Nice\" is not saying something. \"Kind\" is not infecting someone. Kindness is more important than niceness. ","Damon Cameron Ross I need to do that! I’ve been standing next to my cart trying to keep that distance. (Unfortunately only 5’ though. )","Laurie Lingel not sure where you are, but all our stores have markings on the floor to show you where to stand.","Benita Tee you can get most of it, just not the kid seat area where you keep the bread and eggs ","Laurie Lingel that’s when you stretch your arms out quickly and if you make contact that’s on them for being so close ","Rebecca Butler no, Mexico.  They are very friendly here","Laurie Lingel I’ve stopped shopping at stores that do not have markers on the ground.","Caroline Bertinetti sorry, my Internet brevity led to grammatical mistake. Fixed.","Eve Westvik there are markings. Some folks are just oblivious. ","Laurie Lingel Turn around and spritz with the Raid Autumn Fresh and ask her if it really smells like Autumn freshiness. ","I had a group behind me push me up so they were standing in front of the card machine that I had to get help to get them to back up so I could pay and get out. ","Cory Michael lately when people get too close or don't make room for me to pass, I will start coughing. Lol I gotta tell ya, their eyes get big and they move!","Linda Miller I am currently living in a country not my own. In the USA I would probably say back the f  up, but here I try not to be the Ugly American","Don't gaslight me, NPR. I'm f***ing great at gauging physical distance and I don't need your condescending props. ","C Thomas Wilson  just a wee bit into yourself, aren't you.","Anybody see the signs on the doors at West Marine? The one requesting you stay one fathom apart? Fathom refers to depth, so in trump world you're getting burried.","It's easy in Florida: it's a gators length between two people. There ya go...","Paul Holland I just envision my husband, not Michael Jordan LOL. ","Paul Holland in Tennessee we use the simple formula of 2x, where x=the distance by which the Titans lost the Super Bowl that one time","...what about head to foot. Get creative","I have a dog and walk her on a standard 6’ leash. Anyone who owns a dog should know what 6’ looks like (hint: it’s the full length of the leash, not the length of space between you and your dog).","And that is why people need to be staying home as much as they can. Don't get out unless it's for urgent or essential reasons.","I picture my uncle’s laying on the ground when I social distance.  They’re 6’1.  And often people fall short of that so I give a look back or put the shopping cart behind me in the market while I stand in front.  People just don’t get it","Not new, road cyclists have known this for YEARS... Most drivers have no concept what 3' or 4' is for passing safely... it's most often around 2'... why would a pandemic make it any different... LOL","You could be farther and still get infected. You could be closer and not get infected. It depends on a number of factors. Our understanding of COVID has evolved a lot since the 6 feet guideline was established early in the pandemic.","CC RodRod swiss cheese.  Use the model.","CC RodRod I don’t even care about covid it should always be 6’ away unless I know you ","At 6'3 I just imagine where I would faceplant","Stand one Joey Ramone away from others. That’s the best way I remember it.","Asking americans to estimate distances? We're doomed.","But indoors data shows you can get COVID from as much as 10 feet away ","In the military we sleep head to toe to reduce transmission of sickness.  It helps, but sure doesn't stop it when we live so closely together.  I had everything under the sun during my time in basic training, pneumonia and meningitis at the same time.  Nothing like doing pushups indoors in a parka while huge globs of snot the size of a silver dollar are pooling on the floor and your head is pounding.  Getting screamed at by a Drill Sgt. as you try to hurriedly clean it up so he doesn't slip on it is fun.  ","I use shopping carts plus an extra foot","Creepy to feel their breath on the back.worse for me all the droplets drop down on top of my head in my mind's eye,as I am vertically mmm...challenged.","Anything but the metric system eh?","I mean, as far as judging distance goes, what difference would it make? I know a meter is roughly the same as a yard, and both remain a mystery to me ","Jerris Gilbert to each their own, my personal preferred social distance measurement is “two Mario Jumps” ","Joey West 2 meters","Josh Milner yeah, two Mario-jumps","I’ve actually told someone at the store that I’m trying to maintain a “basketball player” distance away from the next person ","Since I'm over 6' tall, I feel my \"6 feet\" is more than most others. For most, it's often 3-4 feet, if that. It's been a bit nerve-wracking to behold.","Actually I’m an interior designer so thankfully I am very good at judging physical distance lol","When proctoring tests, would instruct students that, bubonic plague fleas can jump 5 feet (my height) and to space themselves accordingly. Besides DNA and dental records; an aircrash sorterouter noted that finger tip to fingertip length is the same as height.","It’s a minimum of 6 feet and I don’t get why so many people make sure that they are 6 feet from people when they could easily be further away.","Npr you're slipping. Quite a few grammatical errors and typos of late. It still matters.","Relada L. Miller, your comment has many errors, including an incomplete sentence. ","A coffin’s length between two people.","I’m 6’1 so I just imagine myself falling completely straight towards the closest person, if I think I would hit them then we are too close. I actually go through this scenario pretty much anytime I am at the grocery store or waiting in line.","Thom Woodard I'm not even six foot but that's how I guage the distance as well. Most Ppl just don't have much spatial awareness.","David del Castillo agree on that. It’s probably a good rule for anyone to use since most people are 5-6ft tall.","It's not that they're \"bad at estimating\" they just don't want to do it.","I just imagine, if I fall over, am I close enough to hit somebody else. If possibly yes, I'm too close.","Play Imperial Guard or anything with a lot of Indirect Fire. You'll get awesome at it.","Judging distance is way more difficult than judging height.","I'm 5'8, so I ask myself \"could I do a faceplant with some room to spare?\"","To make life simple. Just carry a 6' pole everywhere you go, and if they get too close, behave like Peter Francis Stager....im sure thatll fo over well.","I know my spacing.  8 years of marching band.","helpful rule for the distance impaired: if you are close enough to tough finger when you both have arms out stretched, you're too close. ","I am just over 6 ft tall, and I literally picture myself laying on the ground to judge how far I should stand, minimally. ","Curtis Lindholm I'm one inch shy of 6'. I do the same thing!","I just carry my crutch and hold it up to hold the line. ","If you're an adult and don't know what 6ft is, you need to kindly just.... Not do anything. I dread what else you're incapable of.","People stand too close in lines at covid testing sites  I feel like I will get covid because I went to get tested just in case","The span of your arms is exactly the same as your height. Use that as a barometer.","TIP:  When I go shopping, even for a gallon of milk, I always get a full size cart so that if the person behind me gets a little to close, I just move to the front of the cart when able to expand the space in front of me and pull it forward as I move in the line with an extended arm.  This keeps the person behind me from getting to close and I avoid any confrontation.","I always picture someone tall lying down on the ground between me and another person... isn't that what everyone does?","Rebecca Hornbrook Thats what I do, and is an easy way to do it. ","Yep. My ex is 6ft.  Then there's the extra benefit of getting to imagine walking over him. ","That's how I've done it from the beginning; standing in line behind someone and imagining if I fell forward at their heels. I'm 6'2\". If I judge I'd hit them, I'm too close.","It really only matters indoors and if you are there for an extended period of time. Contact tracers tend to use 15 minutes as a starting point - less that that and it doesn't really count for much unless you are in-your-face close. In Australia we use 1.5 m, which is only 5 feet and we have pretty much eliminated the virus so if you are a foot under it doesn't matter.Stay home. Wear a mask. Keep your distance. Don't sweat the small stuff! Good luck.","I stay in the house unless I go to the grocery store. I avoid people in general and I work from home. I'm good.","Ha! That's what I've been telling people who are clueless - imagine a tall man stretched out on the floor. It's from his head to his foot - do not come closer to me than that! ","Your closed captions are rather nasty, vile, obscene.  Someone must have hacked them.  As one who is totally deaf, I really rely on CCs. ","Faye Auger Beuby It is a YouTube video. So it likely uses YouTube's auto generated captions. No hacking involved, just an algorithm doing it's best with a wide variety of human speech.But yes, it does fall short.","Impossible to maintain, 100% of the time.  ","Amy Pinkerman Williams it actually is it if you work at it.","I’m 9 months pregnant, due any day. At my doctor appt today this lady came in the elevator and stood right next to me, I sternly but politely? Told her she needed to back up. It was awkward... but I don’t care. ","I've spent my entire life avoiding people. I'm well versed in staying far away ","It’s super easy. You stick out your arm. They stick out their arm. If your hands touch you’re too close to 6 ft to risk it. Now go wash your hands you just touched a stranger. ","James Hush This only works if both people are 6’ tall.","James Hush This is how I think of it. ","I use my shoe. I thought everyone did. ","Hubby is 6'4\".

Like no bloodshed ever came from reading certain religious texts.","Donna Marie Did anyone say anything about banning books?","Donna Marie if White Supremacists and Fascists want to publish that kind of trash then they are free to start their own publishing company. Nobody owes them a printing press or a retail outlet. And if they do choose to self-publish then we are free to boycott any outlet that carries their work. That's how the First Amendment is supposed to work.","Tim Harrington totally agree with that.","The Turner Diaries is a cautionary tale. It is not a how-to manual.","The Nazis banned books too. A good book burning is always the American way. ","Jonathan Lee did you just defend the book that inspired Timothy McVeigh? Eww","Jonathan Lee, I am guessing that you have never heard of this book before. Have a great day...","Jonathan Lee were you that concerned when hundreds and thousands of other books were banned by schools and towns, books like Anne Frank’s Diary, or is the Turner Diaries where you take your stand against censorship? Because that’s pretty telling.","Be careful,  splc wont tolerate any criticism lol","You know the people who imagine that somehow their fantasies about dating a celebrity will somehow come true?  The guys who read The Turner Diaries are like that, except celebrity sex is replaced with mass murder of liberals.  ","And Jews. And black people.

Murder anyone who has half a brain.","Gideon Soule catholics","Skipp Davison is it anti catholic too?","Gideon Soule yes..even though the Catholic Church was one of Germanys biggest accomplishes in the Nazi movement.","I’m guessing the same way it has for decades ","I read that once.  What an ugly, hateful book.","I have seen pirated copies of that at flea markets and gun shows since tbe early 90s. There are also a lot of  cleaned up plagiarized books in the post apocalyptic genre.","Don’t ban the book... just get search warrants for whoever buys it ","There is no such thing as White privilege. It's called racism. Racism does NOT go in reverse. Racism is not ever nor ever was a privilege. It's called Racism. ' White supremacists'is a historical term. We call racist hate groups now. Skip sensational language and unnecessary adjectives. Call it what it is; racism! Racist hate group. Segregationists shall not prevail","Edward Eichinger without White Privilege there would be no racism..white privilige is the belief that one is special and exaulted above other people. That they are smarter and possess superior intellect. Some even believe that other races are not even humans..when someone looks down on others that is racism. White Privilege accomodates that. ","The presence of Racism generates two different experiences, either one of discrimination or one of privilege. ","Edward Eichinger ","Private businesses can make decisions about what books they carry, or don’t carry.  Wingnuts can get their books elsewhere.","That’s the “free market” that conservatives keep telling us about.  ","Josiah Del Rey yes","They can read? Oh s..., now I have to rethink everything!","It's not just The Turner Diaries they pull from:-\"The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan\" by Thomas Dixon-\"Bedford, a World Vision\" by Ellen Williams-\"The Last Confederate Flag\" by Lloyd Lenard-\"Dark Millennium\" by Gerald James McManus-\"Unintended Consequences\" by John Ross-“The Camp of the Saints” by Jean Raspail-“Hunter” by William Pierce (aka Andrew McDonald)-\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" by unknown author (plagiarised from various authors)Just a few.","Kevin M. Oliver  Also, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  That book has been behind Anti-Semitism forever. ","In much the same way that “Battlefield Earth” inspired L Ron Hubbard to seek a more lucrative career, eh?As Tom Waits put it, “ The World is a Hellish place, and Bad Writing is diminishing the quality of our suffering.”Not to make lite of the situation, but these folks are not the sharpest of tools.","I beg to differ. Low intellegence may account for some Trump supporters. But I know many educated people with good minds who have backed him. The make up of his supporters  is a multifaceted phenomena. The quality of the information people consume seems to be a very important factor. Which is why there is concern over the sale of this book. ","There is definitely some physiological phenomena, the extent of which seems to vary between individuals.. my current ‘analogy’ (which is poor, albeit a relative neutral concept) would be to compare such to the varied effectiveness of hypnotism.Our brains are complex chemical factories that have been imprinted and affected by influences starting before we were born, and negative predispositions are not necessarily inversely proportional or even related to “intelligence”. It takes training and diligence, conscious or otherwise, to avoid the worst (such as why I don’t keep extra alcohol at home).","Kathy Matson Lots of intelligent people are lacking in other areas. Everyone has their own specific blind spots, but to see Trump as some sort of a Champion?That takes a pretty substantial disconnect.","Well, some sort of \"disconnect\" fits for sure. Living within a misinformation bubble tends to cut you loose from a good  grounding in reality. Then you have to be a person capable of deep denial to not recognize what you see or hear with your own eyes and ears. Seems like a lot of people simply share Trump's values. They have great pride in being part of his tribe. ","Kathy Matson WHAT values? Nothing Trump says or does is based even remotely on integrity or honor or even fair play, let alone kindness or compassion even a single ounce of caring for his fellow man. Trump is an entitled, self-concerned silver-spooner who never shuts up for one goddamned moment about how “unfair” everyone is to him. The man has NO MORAL COMPASS WHATSOEVER.","Kris Lonborg. Trump values power and a position of dominance. He values the White race over POC. Values men over women. He believes in the survival of the fittest, valuing a strong economy over American lives. He values winning, and  believes the end justifies the means. He values himself over any concern for the well being of others. These are some examples of things important to Trump that are important to his supporters too. It's not pretty. ","Kathy Matson Those thing all belong in the flaming dumpster of History.","The \"shitstain\" rebellion was a complete failure.","Stephen Johnson That is awesome btw","Great, now if they'll just pull Ayn Rand's books from their catalog as well, we might actually start to make some progress. ","Todd Schwartz  progress to what NAZISM ???? ","Mark Wilson Sanity.  Ayn Rand is one of the biggest contributors to the dangerous right-wing delusion that unfettered capitalism is the road to paradise.","TLDR summary of Rand's philosophy: \"God, I love being a sociopath!\"","Rand is more touting the virtues of being a sociopath, it's also poorly written","We already have Nazism Mark, look at the flags that were carried by the terrorist  attack on the capitol last Wednesday.   ","todd shwartz if we want the country saved we should force every student to read ayn rand. this would only trigger candy ass snowflakes. everyone else could really learn something","Todd Schwartz I never saw anything overtly racist in Rand’s writings.Rambling. But not racist. ","Charles M. Heinlen he didn't saying anything about racism (unless he edited).","Todd Schwartz  need more like him ","Kathryn Sullivan  didn’t see anything that resembled Germany ! ","Mark Ayn Rand was a woman. ","Rob for example, they’d learn that libertarianism is garbage","Todd Schwartz Reading “Atlas Shrugged” was its own punishment.","Mark Wilson there were neo Nazi, white power, and confederate flags hoisted. The German flag which I think is black gold and red with a two headed eagle was not present nor was \"anything that resembled Germany\"you dunce.","Charles M. Heinlen He absolutly hated arabs.","Louis Schwartz  A confederate flag is N-O-T a NAZI flag  !!! Race baiters ","Rob Long Ayn Rand is terrible. Not only is her \"philosphy\" morally bankrupt, hypocritical, and demonstrably unfounded, she's a bad writer that writes bad fiction.","that old chestnut..????","They think that Jesus supports them.","Crystal Evans  boy are they wrong ","Crystal Evans delusional ","Peggy Partlow Cameron are they?  The mentality of these extremists is no different from the conquistadors and colonizers of the past.  The concept of non violent Christianity has always been a minority belief in the religion ","Agreed. It’s an ugly piece of work by all accounts.But is censorship really the answer?Because once we turn that road, where will it stop and what will prevent the borders we draw around censorship today from being redrawn tomorrow? ","Charles M. Heinlen, if the government outlaws a book it is censorship - businesses can choose which books they sell as a matter of choice. ","Karen Holt Fetter agreed, until it becomes clear that a few businesses invariably won’t ban a book regardless of public outcry and then there is upward pressure on leadership to start banning books.","Charles M. Heinlen and yet, what books have been banned? The Communist Manifesto wasn't banned at the height of McCarthyism, so I'm not seeing a point","Charles M. Heinlen Evangelicals have been doing it for decades but it's only outlawed if government does it. Amazon is a private company and is free to decide not to sell it.","Charles M. Heinlen: Publishers can refuse to print more books, but that doesn’t mean it’s censorship. ","yeah i get the feeling the only things these folks read are poorly spelled facebook memes. ","Now that the GOP has gone full bore fascist and made it clear that they will accept no election defeat as legitimate and will relinquish no power without being forced to do so, turn out to vote in every election at every level going forward!","Craig Turner Nftg , exactly right,  shipmate.  BZ.","Craig Turner Nftg sounds just like democrats for the last 4 years, doesn't it? Hypocracy runs deep on the left and is really showing hard now.","Dustin Russell It would sound like the Democrats.If the Democrats had stormed the Capitol and were planning to attack the inauguration.","Craig Turner Nftg and what happened during the Kavanaugh hearings again? Thats what I thought. ","Dustin Russell Anyone storm the Capitol during Kavanaugh hearings?","Craig Turner Nftg democrats stormed and vandalized federal buildings. Doeant matter which building, as they are all owned by the taxpayer....hypocracy. its showing.","Dustin Russell Look son... Your attempt to change the subject is noted.However there is one question and one question only at play here.Do you approve of the angry terrorist that stormed the Capitol on Jan 6th?Yes or no?","Craig Turner Nftg I didn't approve of the left terrorist actions all summer, dont approve of what happened on the 6th either. See, I disapprove of all of it, not just the part that might get me 15 seconds of keyboard fame,  such as yourself.","Dustin Russell ah yes, the way they attacked the building in Portland totally was the same as interfering in trying to finish the election of the President. Your whataboutism is showing","Chris Callicoat chose your agenda, but in the end, its the same. You can't sit there and condone domestic terrorism in the name of BLM and then turn around and say that what happened on Jan 6th was worse. Terrorism is terrorism. There is no good terrorism and bad terrorism.","Dustin Russell Actually, everyone protesting with BLM called out the people using the protest as cover for crime sprees. I suspect you already know that. But when you’re trying to justify a fascist coup against your own government you have to use whatever ammo you can find.Even if it’s just diversionary ","Dustin Russell that you don't understand the difference says everything we need to know.","Craig Turner Nftg have you noticed that those at the forefront of the \"coup\" are actually left leaning or extreme leftist? I would assume you knew that already though, as you are a scholar in this...","Give it up dude. You sound like a tape recording stuck on stupid.","Craig Turner Nftg its all good. I would be upset too if I found out my party had been caught leading this one too.","Dustin Russell So that’s the best conspiracy theory you guys can muster now?Wow. QANON is really slipping.","Dustin Russell an empty building in Portland isnt the same as yelling “hang pence”. And you know it. Just stop. ","And let's not forget, that awful book inspired the Oklahoma City bomber. It's a book of evil.","Them, they, these nuts, etc. How do you know what they read or if they are able?","Most of them don't read books. We need to do something about the people generating propaganda who do read books. The books aren't the problem. Widespread racist propaganda IS.","“We need to do something about the people generating propaganda.” Full stop.Social media, talk show hosts, “influencers”, and other such non-IRL interactions — not necessarily books — appear to be largely accountable for the modern mass spread of delusions.","Amazon was supposed to have removed it years ago ","Kevin Schwagg they did, it's not available when you search","Operation White Privilege. 1/6/21.","Chris Maley bingo ","Patrick Quimby Servile racists are desperate to hang on to their dumb supremacist views.","But they cannot read any rand her books are super long and complex.

But you are correct history should be properly remembered ","Censoring books is wrong.  People should be able to freely discuss the ideas in those books n the marketplace of ideas.

","now banning books?","but To Kill a Mockingbird is banned  in many libraries / bookstores around the country -   ","Mac EnTosh um, where?","Where? I know it used to be, but where is it still banned?","Erin Marie  One case  occurred in 2018 at schools in Duluth, Minnesota, where copies of both To Kill a Mockingbird and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn were removed from the classroom. Unlike the previous case, the book was banned due to the accumulation of complaints over the years.   ","n 2017, To Kill a Mockingbird was removed mid-lesson from 8th grade classrooms in Biloxi, Mississippi, over complaints about language in the book, in particular the use of the N-word.

I have a pure  novice debater that tech quit last year but came back for one tournament as a favor... he is listed as jv because literally every tournament we went to last year with him collapsed to jv (he went to 3). He quit bc he didnt feel like he could keep up cause the other debaters just knew basic things that they were still learning. they were made to feel stupid for not knowing things or being flustered as brand new people. We got him to come in for one tournament as a novice and it got collapsed again.This isnt a covid problem. This is a debate community problem about lack of care for novice debate. I feel like I am lying to my students telling them they will debate people with their same ish knowledge base... just to be proven wrong every flippin tournament.I dont do logistics. But someone CEDA/NDT, tournament hosts, tabroom hosts need to figure something out.This isnt right.  We've been talking about debate dying for years.... of course it will die (not bc teams run the k - lookin at prl folk) if we cant get new inexperienced people into the activity to stick with it even if they like it.  If you really tryin to make debate die or only for the most elite... just say that... if not figure it out cause this is bs"]},{"commentid":["981aaa6f4ed371996697a0a4ef273602"],"comments":["The testimony was January 19th  but it was an honor!!"],"id":"14c97b53637a7da136dd0c3f5c446d87","post":[]},{"commentid":["9f67cbbc05a022cfe9786730c7943e64"],"comments":["Omg I just realized I can’t read I thought this said Barkley at first.Berkeley will be double flighted, but BARKLEY is still single flighted.

Not to be declarative, but I'm firm in believing that adults in the space should not solicit students to send them money, at minimum not privately. It puts students in an extremely awkward position. What if that person judges the student and the student hadn't sent them money? That student is now uncertain if the judge can fully disentangle those two events. What if the student feels pressured to send money to that adult? What if the adult is not being honest about their request for money and is running scams on students? Should minors at all be directly solicited with requests to send money? Lots of questions that make me think that this is not appropriate behavior. Perhaps I'm being a bit callous - I naturally don't mean to take away from ameliorating the struggles that our extremely busted society furthers, but I want to make sure that we as coaches and educator are being as mindful as possible with cases like this, even if my position is not universally agreed upon."]},{"commentid":["eee27c68328b2879e5a5aa612d58cb06"],"comments":["My opinion- FOX has a golden opportunity to step up & do what is right.

We are super excited to announce the 2021 Legacy Debate Camp! This summer, we will be holding two sessions. Week one will be held from August 2nd to 6th and week two, which will be a topic prep week, will be held from August 9th 13th. Due to the uncertainty of COVID-19, we have decided to commit to an online platform to ensure the safety and peace of mind of our students, staff, and parents. Below are a few things that make Legacy worth your while, particularly in relation to other summer programs.  Schedule: Below you will find an attachment of our outline for the summer schedule. We’ve worked to try to develop a curriculum that emphasizes student freedom while maintaining the ability to establish relationships with staff and other students the will help students establish a strong footing in the activity. Some of you may be unfamiliar, so I thought I’d outline our vision for what you can expect to get out of your time with us. First and foremost - all of the “lecture,” “drill groups,” and “lecture w/drills” slots will be totally chosen by you! For each slot, we will have a selection of different options in each of the main areas of debate (including Ks, Philosophy/Framework, T/Theory, LARP, and general strategy) and will have a designated scale to indicate experience level (beginner, intermediate, and advanced). This will allow student to have total control over what they learn during camp. We recognize that some students may be unsure what is best for them, which is why have our “advisor” program. Each student will be assigned a staff advisor that will be in communication with you throughout camp to assist you with selecting lectures and drills that match your interests and experience to ensure you maximize your time. The second week of lecture/drill sessions will be focused on how to apply certain positions or strategies to the topic. Second, we will have some lab time - primarily for establishing relationships and learning material we find to be essential for success beyond your selections. This will work quite similarly to how most of you are familiar with what labs are at most camps. Third, projects groups will be implemented in the topic prep section of camp. The topics of these project groups will also be selected by the students. The goal here is for staff to help you write, frontline, and strategize whatever position or type of position you are most interested in reading and have a jump start on well-crafted strategies for the topic. Finally – office hours. We have realized that office hours are one of the best times during camp for students, so we have designated a good portion of the day for them. You’ll be able to sign up for any staff member and can work on whatever you’d like. These slots will be 30 minutes each and, depending on student sign ups, you will be able to sign up for 2-4 sessions with different staff members per day. Staff: While we are still working on finalizing our staff list this summer, Legacy is most interested in hiring staff members that are equipped to be skilled instructors. While most institutions make their hiring decisions mostly on bid count or competitive success, that is only one factor in the hiring process – we aim to hire staff members with specialized and diverse knowledge bases, strong characters, and those with a passion for working with students. Pricing: We’ve done extensive market research to ensure you get the most out of your camp experience for your money. For a standard online camp, one week of is around $1,000. For competitive topic prep sessions, the approximate cost is $800 for roughly half the time you’ll spend with us. At Legacy, our first week costs $600, with the topic prep session costing $800. Our entire two-week program prices out at only $1,250. Thus, by registering for our entire camp experience, you will receive the same amount of coaching for about half the price. We also offer several scholarship opportunities for those that indicate a need for them. We will be following this announcement with special offers, details about camp, and more! We are very much looking forward to a repeat of the success of last year.

Her baby is not strong like me. And remember when Isaiah was a baby and he got really sick? I don’t want that mommy. And like, what if grandma gets sick if no one is wearing a mask? Is she going to die?”“Wow. That’s a lot Corbin.”“Yea I know. I think of that a lot. Cause I know I don’t like when I’m sick. And I don’t want anyone sick. It’s ok to do school at home for now. It’s only hard sometimes.”Corbin is 6. He has ADHD. He has struggled with online schooling. Between my work schedule and my husband’s work schedule, he relies on his sister to help him with school. And she’s in school as well. It hasn’t been easy but to hear him say that just moved me to tears. I love this kid. ￼"]},{"commentid":["41ba43ac0fbee776ffbf2df6fefee055"],"comments":["I would love love LOVE this place, I'm paying $1550 for an apartment off Pacific Highway in Kent right now where I was just recently assaulted at gun point and am dying to move, but I can't afford the 1st, last, and deposit to move in & only make $2400… See More"],"id":"10db89de3c6cb1245513330d48fb6317","post":["Ravensdale house for rent, 2 bed, 1 full bath, woodstove, washer/ dryer, outdoor storage, includes water, trash& recycling, & lawn maintenance No dogs/ no exceptions Cats ok… See More"]},{"commentid":["bb34103bdf036cb33beca8148a88961d"],"comments":["In Austin, I was able to get my first shot.
