","Lee William Rodewald  you’re likely thinking of coal.  Demand for gas is only increasing and will for the foreseeable future.  Domestically, gas is still supplanting coal as more and more coal plants get converted to gas.

Globally, demand in Africa and Asia is expected to double in the next few decades.Despite the western NGOs push for renewable and their efforts to promote sustainable investment.

","Adriano Sánchez I'm an environment scientist and could have easily entered the oil and gas industry when I graduated to make tons of money during the boom.

Everything is dependent on demand and market prices. Additionally, oil companies often ruin communities by moving in quickly and leaving a mess when the reserves dry up.

Don’t even ask about how they handled NORM containment and disposal, because the short answer is that they didn’t. If you’re interested in how chemical companies like Dow ruin communities, watch The Devil We Know. However, many other companies like Exxon and Valero place a high value on employee safety and environmental compliance and safety, at least presently. I’ve seen both good and bad, but ultimately the people working these jobs are just trying to provide the best lives they can for themselves and their families. ","Bethany Elizondo except the people in this article aren’t safety experts, they were clearly going into fields that were money based. One of them even says they saw the salary and went for it.

","AU N people do become dentists for the money lol.  That’s true. There’s certain cushy professions, but people working in the hospital aren’t getting the nice life that everyone else has and everyone thinks they make a lot of money but they don’t. I actually don’t think dentists make as much as they thought they would have either with student loans and the costs of running a practice... there’s a reason why it’s the medical profession with so much suicide and substance abuse.

They'll adapt. At least the smarter ones will.","Jim Safranek That is a great point, too! Culturally, the view of the fossil fuel industry varies significantly by region, so for many kids, it seemed like a smart choice. But again, petroleum engineering is a very rigorous program, and has a strong foundation in physics, calculus, and geological sciences, all of which can be applied to various industries. It wouldn't be difficult for petroleum engineers to do a Masters degree in an entirely separate STEM field because of this (I actually know an environmental science Masters student at my university who has a bachelor's in petroleum engineering). Ultimately, if they put in some energy into finding an alternative career path, they'll be fine. Masters degrees are also suggested for applied sciences anyway. It sucks for them though because engineering is one of the few STEM disciplines where you can get a well paying job with a Bachelors, but for a  state or federal job, a Masters degree is probably preferred anyway.","Sierra Raglin yep.

And a heck of a lot more satisfying then destroying our planet and the lives on it.","Oil and gas states have suffered boom and bust since the beginning of the gas driven engine.  We saw it growing up.  The problem is, people refuse to admit that fossil fuels are killing the planet.  I say Petroleum Engineering is still a viable job; however, there won't be the demand for them.  BRANCH OUT!  Putting one's eggs all in one basket is foolish.  Alternate energy sources would be a great adjunct to this degree.  Hey, doubtful that in some states (WY) for example, that electric and solar cars will take the place of fossil fuels in the near future. Just my opinion. Our towns are too few and too far apart. This dilemma for college students is NOT new.  There are degree holders of all ages who prepared for a job, and the market dried up.  Be creative.  Amazon jobs are pretty good...speaking from information from someone who works for Amazon.","Lol whatever get a job in renewables and get w the times. ","Jack Stauss OMG totally! The existence and tone of this article are everything that is wrong with The Times.","And I see you are in fine company in doing so! An old college chum who is a tireless activist for change and a terrific writer I befriended at my last residency do, too. And now, so do I! Thanks!","It’s too bad that no one told them about climate change & how the oil industry is a major factor. ","Even if you don't believe we should be using petroleum products for fuel, we still need petroleum to manufacture plastics. Even if you think we should transition to more durable and sustainable materials for food packaging, we still need single use plastics for medical and surgical uses. Even if you want us to transition to sustainable energy sources such as wind and solar, the advanced composite materials and copolymers needed to make turbine blades and solar panels are petroleum products. So do not thoughtlessly celebrate the decline of the oil industry. If you are like me you would hope that we stop burning so much petroleum for fuel, not only for reasons of climate change but also that its a finite resource that we need for other materials, without which much of our technology cannot exist.","You created a story about how the pandemic has negatively effected young people trying to break through in the oil industry? I mean, this isn’t an Onion article? WTH, man?!?! Let’s focus on some of the OTHER industries that have been destroyed. Like, ANY OTHER INDUSTRY!!","Are you freaking kidding me with this story. Yup, better continue destroying the planet, so some young adults can keep their careers, but screw all those who can't pursue their careers because of medical debt, school debt, food, or housing insecurities. Just fine journalism New York Times.","Eric Abbott couldn't agree more","This was happening WAY before the pandemic. I work in HVAC. People don’t want oil anymore, not customers nor industry workers. It’s dirty, and technicians don’t like working with it. Times are evolving into healthier and sustainable methods. Get a job in another energy sector. #Evolve ","Weird article about deranged youth  accompanied by photo of a non-idealist looking into the ... past. \"Did you ever hear of a solar panel?” she recalls the Uber driver asking her and her friends.","I don't think that slap in the face was literal enough.","Maybe they shouldn’t have pursued a career in planetary destruction and death? They could always become coal miners.","Poor fossil fuel people...awww...so sad. Going into a field that is obsolete and destroys the planet and then finding out the Robber Barons took all the money already. Gee whiz I am just sooo sad for them.","Oh no! Not the poor oil-industry employees! It’s not like there is a huge booming career field in renewable energy, or anything!","Why would anybody want to pay to get in to an occupation that is destined to fade away. Fossil fuels are being replaced and it's way over due","How long and how deep can we dig for oil, fossils, and other natural resources.  We humans instead of enjoying the gift of nature have utilized it for our own needs..... now it's nature's turn. Climatic change should be considered and managed...","I think the opioid crisis has impacted the Sackler family's business as well.","As dismaying as it could be, that is oil for you, volatile, dirty, and that is a sign of what your professional life will be. So they can see this for what it is and still have time to pivot to another industry or shut up and wait it out like everyone else that has lost their jobs in the oil industry. \"Slap in the face\" is a bratty statement when so many people have lost their livelihoods, business and lives due to the pandemic in every industry.","Ana Del Campo Mendizábal I just don't get this type of thinking. There is a fortune to be made in green energy - an industry on the cusp of breaking out. The NYT is just ridiculous sometimes. ","And if you think about it, why are people in the oil industry paid so much? because the industry is unstable and volatile, they pay you a lot so you can survive the down times. Instead of doing their homework, the NYT is just parroting the dismay of a very narrow minded student who decided to learn piece of an industry that she clearly did not fully understand, and apparently neither the NYT.","“We got a slap in the face, an entirely unforeseen situation that rocked our entire mind-set,” said Ms. Burns, who is studying petroleum engineering....ummm look I am the person that advocates for someone to study why their hearts desire but you can’t just say “I never expected this” considering climate change discussions have been a well known thing for like a decade. Go in a masters in a renewable energy field.","All from Texas, magical land of deregulation... it’s hard to believe that none of these otherwise intelligent folks could imagine the decline of fossil fuels within their own lifetime. This is more than a half century coming (some would argue too late), and obvious if only they had been paying attention. I guess this is what happens when you let giant industry write school curricula.","It has ever been thus. Oil is notoriously cyclical. This may have been its last hurrah. ","Hunter McKay How many times have I seen this since 1968?","Sean Hickey i don’t know. My roller coaster ride began in ‘81.","Will not work without govt subsidies and is going to put us in a position of once again depending on the middle east  for oil. We are currently energy independent.","Oh dear. Some of the most profitable industries in the history of corporate profits will slowly become slightly less profitable with ample time to adjust and change course. My sympathy is measurable.","People who voted for Biden cut their own throats!!! Asinine voter base. Haven’t lived life long enough to think it through .  Heard fascinating quote on Law and Order. I forget who said...“ If your under 30 and don’t vote Democrat ... you don’t have a heart!If your over 30 and don’t vote Republican, you don’t have a brain!”There’s so much truth in there ","Boo Hoo - you have the world ahead of you, plenty of renewable energy, and you focus on Oil? What is this, There Will Be Blood? Good grief. ","The 1998 graduating class of travel agents sheds a single tear","It’s still hilarious that most people think they can live without the O&G industry even with renewable energy and alternatives.    ","Petroleum and NG are way more than fuel for cars or homes.  The energy it provides, we don't have the infrastructure to make up for with solar, wind, hyrdo, etc.. And petroleum is a part of so many other aspects of the economy.  It won't stay down for long.  Too much dependency built into how we live. ","While I can certainly sympathize with the lack of immediate prospects, I can’t help but think the skills and knowledge derived from their chosen majors can’t be applied elsewhere. This is where a career placement counselor at the university could come in handy. ","Well maybe they should have been more progressive and know oil is a 19th century fuel. Time to make a career with green energy.","And yet others fear that the growing concerns about climate change may not lead to  enough of a decline in oil and gas to make a difference. ","We’ve know for decades that Cole, oil, gas, even hydropower, were in decline. renewable energy is the further.  Several energy sources pollute the air and water, hydropower is in decline because of drought, and dams have caused a decline in native fish and salmon numbers.  They chose the wrong fields to go into, it’s happen to many a person.  At some point we’ve all had to reinvent ourselves as the job market changed.  Take that new education and turn things around, find ways to reapply the things you learned towards renewable energy or clean up.","AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAYoung people *chose* to enter the fossil fuel industry today? And we are supposed to be sympathetic?","Times change. Change is hard. Success comes to those who accept change and adapt. ","I'm quite a bit more concerned about the reports that emergency room residents who are graduating, having spent the last year at the front lines of the pandemic, are not only not finding jobs but having supposedly secure contracts withdrawn.  These are folks who have spent years to become full-fledged docs & many carry student loan debt in excess of $300k.  More proof that our health care system is insane.  People who threw in with the oil industry with all that's been known for YEARS about climate change and the promise of renewables,    ehhh.  Not so worried.","Whalers went out of business when the demand for Whale Oil stopped, the Milk Man went out of business when supermarkets became a thing and in some parts of the world, the Pizza Guy is no longer a thing thanks to Uber Eats.Saving the oil industry makes as much sense as bringing back the Whaling industry and Milk Man.","Justin Laico hhahahahahahaha that's a good one ","Everyday more and more people are switching to clean energy. Why in the world would they think the oil industry would be a secure career. ","As I’m sure these young engineers told many a humanities major during their undergraduate careers, find a job the market has deemed more valuable. ","Who cares about oil careers? Time to focus on renewable enegy careers and clean energy and forget about oil. Isn't this 2021 and not 1950!","Smh... If you don’t want to get slapped in the face, don’t stick your head in front of a rapidly oncoming hand.  While I hope these young people can find decent jobs outside the oil and gas industry, I wonder about these students’ characters.  They all seem like they were pursuing jobs in oil and gas primarily for the money.  They were willing to pursue filthy lucre despite knowing the harm gas and oil contribute to the environment, and despite the push towards renewables.  The only things getting rich may well be student loan providers and my sense of irony.","How getting a Master's and calling it \"an entirely unforeseen situation\" even converges, in 2020? Graduate students are supposed to be taught critical thinking, it seems to-be oil industry professionals were taught selective blindness instead.","That’s what happens when you choose the path of greed. Now go take what you learned in school and go work for Dinosaur museum!!","Honestly, I think those guys would find this article pretty offensive. They are all smart enough to take some other career path, if it is the case that oil industry is cutting as many jobs as NYT reported. It would be just another industry which is trying to reshape itself in new fashion like nuclear or banking industry.Graduated people must understand that when they enter the labor market they are free to deviate from a single path. ","They’re young , intelligent, resilient and can now change course and help create more renewable energy ideas and creations. It is time to stir away from old ways that have only added to our climate crisis and for old greedy oil people to step aside. ","Wonder if there ever was a piece about young aspiring tobacco business (Phillip Morris), savings and loan (Wells Fargo), or energy company (Enron) folks.

Why go study such a field? ","Florent D'Haultfoeuille very skeptical this is a solution as far as we don't realize the planet we live in and its limitations... but this isn't really something you \"study\" but rather learn it and face it.

They can work at Trader Joe’s or bike shops with all the other advanced degrees.","Imagine being a young person aware of the climate crisis and expecting to start a career in the fossil fuel industry... in 2021...  ","Maybe they should look into blacksmithing and telephone switch operation as alternatives.","Obama made it clear the US was headed toward renewable energy. I get it tho, they were in high school, possibly middle school. But, the adults at the colleges they attended knew this and should have done something about their course selection. But then, colleges are part of the reason for our young people struggling in this country. ","And which American Petroleum Institute press secretary pitched this story to your editors?","Go to work into renewable energy careers instead.","I can’t believe I have a degree in horse buggies and everybody is driving cars now. ","Should have gone into renewable energy.","If you go to college and haven't got the message about the future of the oil and gas industry, something went wrong.

","In tennis, this is what is known as an unforced error","“We got a slap in the face, an entirely unforeseen situation that rocked our entire mind-set” oh my. This was entirely foreseen.

","Not reading the room when they picked their specialty. I'm sure they're smart enough to adapt quickly.","I don't begrudge these young people for sharing their experience, but the way this story is told is really tone-deaf. What do the editors want us to feel about it? If they were, say, front-line workers in the industry who had few alternative career options then I could definitely empathize; but these young people made the choice to enter this industry primarily in pursuit of $$ while ignoring the fact that climate change is making this industry less and less profitable in the long run anyway. (I don't want to blame them for wanting to join an \"evil\" industry, just pointing out that this industry needs to transition NOW with or without the pandemic, and that transition would involve slowing down or restructuring.)","Minnesota now get 50% of its energy from renewables, solar and wind. The reliance on fossil fuels will is dwindling. Perhaps it's time to end their subsidies (welfare).","Why are they not going into renewable energy?? Bad advice from their advisors, i guess?  Clearly they are not watching what is happening in their field.","They had a few decades worth of data to show that perceptions are changing out of oil's favor...that's a terrible position to be in, but it wasn't the pandemic that killed oil, it was industrial progress and changing technology","Probably not the best choice of career given current move to renewables and away from fossil fuels. They must obviously think there's going to be a swing back to oil and coal??","Have they never heard of alternative energy sources? This is literally Darwin’s failure to adapt...","There just isn't any legitimate reason for the Oil industry to continue.","Wow, it’s almost as if the folks who “did everything they were supposed to do” are also getting crushed by capitalism. Maybe it wasn’t the avocado toast after all ","Best part of this absurd article: “Ms. Burns, 22, said her choices have narrowed considerably over the last nine months. With opportunities in oil and gas limited, she recently accepted an internship with an engineering consulting firm specializing in energy conservation, and she may eventually apply to graduate school in environmental science.”","Who cares? Adapt and be flexible. I did a masters in “Museum Anthropology”, and guess what? I don’t work in a museum. I’m not looking for sympathy, and I’m sure if any fine art student complained about not having a career in the arts, they would be mocked for it. Why aren’t these folks who choose a career in a destructive and dying industry treated the same? ","Art majors know all about this.Asbestos industry slowed down too. Life changes, adapt","Hopefully this encourages them to pivot to careers in renewable energy. Oil is dead. ","I'm sure that the guy who had just opened his wagon wheel repair business in the early 1900's, only to see his potential customers buying automobiles, felt the same way.  As tough as it is, that's life, and the same fate could be waiting for a lot of us in the next 10 years.","If we can hold the pharmaceutical companies responsible for the opioid crisis we sure as shootin can hold the oil industry to blame for global warming which is catastrophically worse.","Well, those young people can use their talents in protecting the planet instead. If they haven't noticed what is going on in the world, I doubt they are as smart as they think they are. ","I’m not even reading this.  Screw them.  Willing to sacrifice the planet for personal wealth Is beyond.   ","These young people need to become as diversified in their energy sector studies as their chosen industry ought to be in the interest of viability.","The generations that let Exxon get away with hiding their 1980s study confirming and predicting almost every environmental consequence happening now owes this generation an apology for even letting there still be any fossil fuels left.","But Daddy, I wanted to be an Oil Baron! Make them stop caring about the Earth right nooOOoooOooOoOoooOooOooOOOOooooow","We’ve known this for years...  ...Decades in fact.... I don’t feel bad if you chose a career promoting the destruction of our lives. ","So are we supposed to cry for these people because they have degrees? Because money is the only difference I’m seeing between them & coal miners. At least miners are (often) victims of circumstance, a lack of other options. These oil guys are just greedy.","Ben Boleyn anyone who really thought to themselves \"yeah, I think I'll get a career in this declining industry that will be obsolete in 20 years\" truly had it coming ","I salute those farmers in our province in the Philippines who still use the antiquated means of farming, with no oil or gas involved. Life is good for them after harvesting their crops devoid of fertilizers even if they are low on cash needed to buy new clothes for their children. At least, the serenity on the farm is indeed priceless.","The issue is that society and government has continued to place the majority of funds and investment into the fossil fuel industry, rather than accepting and funding non-carbon alternatives like solar, hydro, etc. We have raised a whole generation of new workers to believe that oil is the only one worth investing our time in, and have created an environment of huge financial gain to any young person willing to dedicate themselves to it. Now they are trained in a dying industry and will suffer financially if they have to change careers. I don’t agree with the oil industry, but if we’re phasing it out, we need to provide free training and increased benefits and incentives to get oil employees to switch and train in another trade. ","Conservatives complain about “liberal degrees” being a waste of time but will send their kids to school for a career in a dying industry. Fascinating. ","Was an article posted about the poor employees at VCR plants who had to find new work or retain after their industry became antiquated?Seriously what kind of dystopian article is this?  Next will their be an article about the starving interns at a fracking company poisoning water tables, or a poor chemist who didn't get a bonus for working on opioids???","Fossil fuel is a dying industry. As capitalists we should be willing to let dying industries do so, and prepare young people for careers in industries that are growing and have a future.

He made financial deals for his buddies and him to get richer and gain more power . The jobs will continue to go .

Millions dead from a disease that at least has partial roots in climate change and NYT wants us to cry for those \"seeking elite positions\" within the oil companies who would further the destruction of the planet?

","I’m sorry but if you thought getting into the oil and gas industry was good idea within the past 5 years was a good idea then you weren’t paying attention. ","Sadly, no career is future proof.
