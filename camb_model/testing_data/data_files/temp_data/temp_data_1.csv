"Still wasn't 6 ft, so I was annoyed, but I just got away as quickly as possible.",2_1_4

...what about head to foot.,2_30_1
Get creative,2_30_2
I have a dog and walk her on a standard 6’ leash.,2_31_1
"Anyone who owns a dog should know what 6’ looks like (hint: it’s the full length of the leash, not the length of space between you and your dog).",2_31_2
And that is why people need to be staying home as much as they can.,2_32_1
Don't get out unless it's for urgent or essential reasons.,2_32_2
I picture my uncle’s laying on the ground when I social distance.,2_33_1

People just don’t get it,2_33_4
"Not new, road cyclists have known this for YEARS...",2_34_1
Most drivers have no concept what 3' or 4' is for passing safely... it's most often around 2'... why would a pandemic make it any different... LOL,2_34_2

Actually I’m an interior designer so thankfully I am very good at judging physical distance lol,2_52_1
"When proctoring tests, would instruct students that, bubonic plague fleas can jump 5 feet (my height) and to space themselves accordingly.",2_53_1
Besides DNA and dental records; an aircrash sorterouter noted that finger tip to fingertip length is the same as height.,2_53_2
It’s a minimum of 6 feet and I don’t get why so many people make sure that they are 6 feet from people when they could easily be further away.,2_54_1
Npr you're slipping.,2_55_1
Quite a few grammatical errors and typos of late.,2_55_2

A coffin’s length between two people.,2_57_1
"I’m 6’1 so I just imagine myself falling completely straight towards the closest person, if I think I would hit them then we are too close.",2_58_1

Thom Woodard I'm not even six foot but that's how I guage the distance as well.,2_59_1
Most Ppl just don't have much spatial awareness.,2_59_2

This keeps the person behind me from getting to close and I avoid any confrontation.,2_75_2
I always picture someone tall lying down on the ground between me and another person... isn't that what everyone does?,2_76_1
"Rebecca Hornbrook Thats what I do, and is an easy way to do it.",2_77_1

My ex is 6ft.,2_78_2
Then there's the extra benefit of getting to imagine walking over him.,2_78_3
That's how I've done it from the beginning; standing in line behind someone and imagining if I fell forward at their heels.,2_79_1
I'm 6'2,2_79_2

"Your closed captions are rather nasty, vile, obscene.",2_83_1
Someone must have hacked them.,2_83_2
"As one who is totally deaf, I really rely on CCs.",2_83_3

I like Zhuang Zhou's stuff best of the Taoists.,5_1_1
"It is what set McVeigh off, why is it still being sold.?",6_1_1
Bezo not rich enough?,6_1_2
Kathryn Sullivan mainly WS independent publishers I imagine,6_2_1
"Amazon is not the only source, if it is a source for this type of publication.",6_3_1
"Kathryn Sullivan The Turner Diaries aren't available on Amazon, so nothing to do with Bezos.",6_4_1
"It's primarily independent, far right publishers selling it from their web sites.",6_4_2
Kathryn Sullivan exactly what I said.,6_5_1
I had to read that book in college getting my libtard degree...,6_6_1
"I bet the entire book has been .pdf on the internet.Again, Turner is a cautionary tale, not a how-to manual.",6_7_1
"I have to ask if the person making these claims even read the book that they refer to....I'm sure I know the answer, as most of those that speak and reference things haven't actually read what they reference.",6_8_1
Dustin Russell  You sound suspiciously like a person defending this offal.,6_9_1
I read the book and it is most definitely an incendiary book for racists and anti government traitors.,6_9_2
Dustin Russell  And your response just confirms what I wrote.,6_10_1
"Nice try, boy.",6_10_2
Dustin Russell *hypocrisy.,6_11_1
There are no Cliff Notes because the book is dumbed down to be understood by the Neanderthals who support it.,6_11_2
Why are you defending the turner diaries?,6_12_1
Dustin Russell,6_13_1
"Dustin Russell that's like saying ""how can you say Mein Kampf is racist if you haven't read it cover-to-cover in the original German?",6_14_1
"Steven Corradi just FYI, you have no clue who you may be talking to, so, you try to accuse me all you want, but your left hypocracy is showing.",6_15_1
I didn't specify anything about my thoughts on the book.,6_15_2
"I stated that most people are only told of highlights of a publication, and they are scholars then.",6_15_3
There are no cliffs notes for this book.,6_15_4
Dustin Russell the book was literally written by a self-described white supremacist,6_16_1
"Warren F if you ready my comment and actually understood it, you would see that I'm not defending anything, only making a comment that most people, including the person that spoke this, hasn't even read what they preach about.",6_17_1
"As stated, there are no cliffs notes for this book, therefore just because you reference it, doesn't mean you're a scholar of it.",6_17_2
Dustin Russell uh huh... What about the book are they missing?,6_18_1
The book you're implying is not as bad as others say.,6_18_2
Camille DeBose pretty standard meme from the left when they know they have no ground to stand on.,6_19_1
"You know that dictators don't get suppressed, they do the suppressing, right?",6_19_2
Steven Corradi na he's not even that.,6_20_1
He has no idea about the book.,6_20_2
He just thinks that any monitoring of fascists ideological influences is tantamount to 'silencing' (silencing of whom?,6_20_3
"Who knows, he certainly doesn't, but he's here to tell you....you're wrong for even mentioning the book for what it is).",6_20_4
It's apathetic posturing and self-righteous obtuseness.,6_20_5
Steven Corradi and what point were you trying to make again?,6_21_1
"Please tell the viewers in the back, because they are still confused with your topic dodging.",6_21_2
Dustin Russell y’all this Florida man is an anti masker lol scroll through his page it’s a b*got treasure trove,6_22_1
Dustin Russell standard response to KKK supporters.,6_23_1
Have a good day fascist.,6_23_2
"Dustin Russell if the Very Hungry Caterpillar had inspired countless acts of White Supremacist Terror then yeah, maybe I'd assume there was something racist about it even before reading it.",6_24_1
"Warren F if you reference anything in life, do you sit there and tell people ""Well, *insert name* told me, so its true",6_25_1
No you don't.,6_25_2
In this case I'm simply stating that the author is most likely doing just that.,6_25_3
Taking what someone else said and speaking of it as they are a scholar.,6_25_4
Dustin Russell have you?,6_26_1
"by all means, tell us what the article author is missing.",6_27_1
you seem to have an extensive knowledge of the turner diaries.,6_27_2

Read the book?,6_28_2
"I have, multiple times actually.",6_28_3
"It was a request from my chief of security to do such, so I could see what the people we dealt with, thought like.",6_28_4
"Warren F have you even read it, or are you one of the scholars which I speak of?",6_29_1
"Dustin Russell sure, then why assume the author has not also read the book?",6_30_1
If you know what it's about....is there something that the article false states about the book?,6_30_2
Just trying to understand your angle..but I guess we all should have know you were once a professional nazi hunter lol,6_30_3
"Jack Garratt ok, and your point?",6_31_1
"Where you are going right now would show that since this employee of the SPLC cited the book, they would have to be one too, as they cited from it.",6_31_2
Seb Arroyo I can assume pretty safely that they haven't.,6_32_1
Its not part of the curriculum for them.,6_32_2
It was always bits and pieces that were shown around to try to tie their arguments to.,6_32_3
Dustin Russell and you know this about Steven Corradi how?,6_33_1
You know what people say about “assumptions”.,6_33_2
Dustin Russell what?,6_34_1
Steven Corradi no idea about the book?,6_35_1
You have to dodge your own posts now and try to slip things in there?,6_35_2
"Come on, man!",6_35_3
"Tim Harrington if I tell you the hungry little caterpillar is a racist book about how to end civilization, will you believe me?",6_36_1
"If so, i have some ocean front property in Arizona I will sell you cheap",6_36_2
"Jack Garratt younrang in and I'm trying to see where you're going with it, or just attempting 15 seconds of keyboard fame like your comrades?",6_37_1
"Teresa Rodriguez just remember, people are assuming that I'm speaking assumptions...and its assume, not assumptions if you want to get left technical.",6_38_1
Dustin Russell how would you know that?,6_39_1
Dustin Russell what's your favorite part?,6_40_1
Dustin Russell I genuinely don’t understand what you’re saying,6_41_1
"Jack Garratt its ok, I will allow you time to think about it.",6_42_1
"Dustin Russell Kind of like people who blame Pelosi as Speaker of the House, when Mitch is the Speaker for the Senate and anytime he wanted to could have presented a Bill from the Senate?",6_43_1
Are you referring to people like that?,6_43_2
"Who don’t read and just make snap feel good to make them, judgements?",6_43_3
Or maybe reading a book by a Neo-Nazi author isn’t about gardening?,6_43_4
Dustin Russell Bottom line it.,6_44_1
Have YOU read the book?,6_44_2
Have YOU read the article?,6_44_3
Do you have any specific evidence to support your supposition that the author has not read it?,6_44_4
Do you disagree with his arguments?,6_44_5
Dustin Russell you’ve had plenty of time to either clarify your own views or point out exactly what the author got wrong.You’ve done neither.,6_45_1
I don't get your beef.,6_46_1
You seem to be casting a lot of crap at people just so you can feel right.,6_46_2
Dustin Russell you seem to be doing a lot of assuming for someone who also rails against that,6_47_1
Dustin Russell I have to ask if you’re the kind of officious idiot who voted for trump and still has no idea what an idiot they are,6_48_1
Text SEDITION to 50409 and Resistbot will send letters to each of your Congress members (2 Senators and 1 Representative) requesting them to urge Nancy Pelosi not to seat any of the 126 Representatives who are trying to undermine our Constitution and overthrow the will of the people.This is a legal and viable action that can start to hold these Republicans accountable for their treachery.,6_49_1
Join me in urging your Congress members to support this action.,6_49_2

How??,6_53_1
Joanne Siegla probably by taking advantage of the GOP’s favorite policy to not tax the wealthy.,6_54_1
I'm not sure that the way to evade violence is to suppress a book.,6_55_1
Welcome to the Radical Right.,6_56_1
"Friends and family of these insurrectionists should not feel guilty about turning them in to the FBI, they've already shown themselves capable of trying to murder someone, and in some cases did.",6_57_1
A copy of the book of was found in Timothy McVeigh’s possession when he was arrested shortly after the bombing in OKC.,6_58_1
Josiah Del Rey Irrelevant.,6_59_1
Stephanie Salazar: Maybe to you.,6_60_1
Josiah Del Rey it’s not irrelevant to her.,6_61_1
She perceives it as threatening to her that it be relevant to other people.,6_61_2
"Justin Miguel Shaw Don't be ridiculous, it's only those like you whole obsess over such nonsensical thinking.",6_62_1
Ciao,6_62_2
"Stephanie Salazar says the delusional waste of life who’s been sitting in the Trump dumpster fire for the last few years.Have fun there, loser.",6_63_1
There’s a lot of money behind these terrorists.,6_64_1
They’ll probably print up their own editions.,6_64_2
Maybe the “Stop the steal” fund or another right wing fundraiser?,6_64_3
There might even be an addendum on how to stay under the radar of law enforcement but I don’t think too many terrorists could read that much.,6_64_4

"One starts and then what is the next one, and the next one...",6_69_4
Donna Marie Yeah.,6_70_1
Like no bloodshed ever came from reading certain religious texts.,6_70_2
Donna Marie Did anyone say anything about banning books?,6_71_1
Donna Marie if White Supremacists and Fascists want to publish that kind of trash then they are free to start their own publishing company.,6_72_1
Nobody owes them a printing press or a retail outlet.,6_72_2
And if they do choose to self-publish then we are free to boycott any outlet that carries their work.,6_72_3
That's how the First Amendment is supposed to work.,6_72_4
Tim Harrington totally agree with that.,6_73_1
The Turner Diaries is a cautionary tale.,6_74_1
It is not a how-to manual.,6_74_2
The Nazis banned books too.,6_75_1
A good book burning is always the American way.,6_75_2
Jonathan Lee did you just defend the book that inspired Timothy McVeigh?,6_76_1
Eww,6_76_2
"Jonathan Lee, I am guessing that you have never heard of this book before.",6_77_1
Have a great day...,6_77_2
"Jonathan Lee were you that concerned when hundreds and thousands of other books were banned by schools and towns, books like Anne Frank’s Diary, or is the Turner Diaries where you take your stand against censorship?",6_78_1
Because that’s pretty telling.,6_78_2
"Be careful,  splc wont tolerate any criticism lol",6_79_1
You know the people who imagine that somehow their fantasies about dating a celebrity will somehow come true?,6_80_1

I read that once.,6_88_1

I have seen pirated copies of that at flea markets and gun shows since tbe early 90s.,6_89_1

Edward Eichinger without White Privilege there would be no racism..white privilige is the belief that one is special and exaulted above other people.,6_92_1
That they are smarter and possess superior intellect.,6_92_2
Some even believe that other races are not even humans..when someone looks down on others that is racism.,6_92_3
White Privilege accomodates that.,6_92_4

I beg to differ.,6_102_1
Low intellegence may account for some Trump supporters.,6_102_2
But I know many educated people with good minds who have backed him.,6_102_3
The make up of his supporters  is a multifaceted phenomena.,6_102_4
The quality of the information people consume seems to be a very important factor.,6_102_5
Which is why there is concern over the sale of this book.,6_102_6
"There is definitely some physiological phenomena, the extent of which seems to vary between individuals.. my current ‘analogy’ (which is poor, albeit a relative neutral concept) would be to compare such to the varied effectiveness of hypnotism.Our brains are complex chemical factories that have been imprinted and affected by influences starting before we were born, and negative predispositions are not necessarily inversely proportional or even related to “intelligence”.",6_103_1
"It takes training and diligence, conscious or otherwise, to avoid the worst (such as why I don’t keep extra alcohol at home).",6_103_2

"Well, some sort of ""disconnectfits for sure.",6_105_1
Living within a misinformation bubble tends to cut you loose from a good  grounding in reality.,6_105_2
Then you have to be a person capable of deep denial to not recognize what you see or hear with your own eyes and ears.,6_105_3
Seems like a lot of people simply share Trump's values.,6_105_4
They have great pride in being part of his tribe.,6_105_5
Kathy Matson WHAT values?,6_106_1
"Nothing Trump says or does is based even remotely on integrity or honor or even fair play, let alone kindness or compassion even a single ounce of caring for his fellow man.",6_106_2
"Trump is an entitled, self-concerned silver-spooner who never shuts up for one goddamned moment about how “unfair” everyone is to him.",6_106_3
The man has NO MORAL COMPASS WHATSOEVER.,6_106_4
Kris Lonborg.,6_107_1
Trump values power and a position of dominance.,6_107_2
He values the White race over POC.,6_107_3
Values men over women.,6_107_4
"He believes in the survival of the fittest, valuing a strong economy over American lives.",6_107_5
"He values winning, and  believes the end justifies the means.",6_107_6
He values himself over any concern for the well being of others.,6_107_7
These are some examples of things important to Trump that are important to his supporters too.,6_107_8

Ayn Rand is one of the biggest contributors to the dangerous right-wing delusion that unfettered capitalism is the road to paradise.,6_113_2
"TLDR summary of Rand's philosophy: ""God, I love being a sociopath!",6_114_1
"Rand is more touting the virtues of being a sociopath, it's also poorly written",6_115_1
"We already have Nazism Mark, look at the flags that were carried by the terrorist  attack on the capitol last Wednesday.",6_116_1
todd shwartz if we want the country saved we should force every student to read ayn rand.,6_117_1
this would only trigger candy ass snowflakes.,6_117_2
everyone else could really learn something,6_117_3
Todd Schwartz I never saw anything overtly racist in Rand’s writings.Rambling.,6_118_1
But not racist.,6_118_2
Charles M. Heinlen he didn't saying anything about racism (unless he edited).,6_119_1

The mentality of these extremists is no different from the conquistadors and colonizers of the past.,6_133_2
The concept of non violent Christianity has always been a minority belief in the religion,6_133_3
Agreed.,6_134_1
"It’s an ugly piece of work by all accounts.But is censorship really the answer?Because once we turn that road, where will it stop and what will prevent the borders we draw around censorship today from being redrawn tomorrow?",6_134_2
"Charles M. Heinlen, if the government outlaws a book it is censorship - businesses can choose which books they sell as a matter of choice.",6_135_1
"Karen Holt Fetter agreed, until it becomes clear that a few businesses invariably won’t ban a book regardless of public outcry and then there is upward pressure on leadership to start banning books.",6_136_1
"Charles M. Heinlen and yet, what books have been banned?",6_137_1
"The Communist Manifesto wasn't banned at the height of McCarthyism, so I'm not seeing a point",6_137_2
Charles M. Heinlen Evangelicals have been doing it for decades but it's only outlawed if government does it.,6_138_1
Amazon is a private company and is free to decide not to sell it.,6_138_2

"Craig Turner Nftg sounds just like democrats for the last 4 years, doesn't it?",6_143_1
Hypocracy runs deep on the left and is really showing hard now.,6_143_2
Dustin Russell It would sound like the Democrats.If the Democrats had stormed the Capitol and were planning to attack the inauguration.,6_144_1
Craig Turner Nftg and what happened during the Kavanaugh hearings again?,6_145_1
Thats what I thought.,6_145_2
Dustin Russell Anyone storm the Capitol during Kavanaugh hearings?,6_146_1
Craig Turner Nftg democrats stormed and vandalized federal buildings.,6_147_1
"Doeant matter which building, as they are all owned by the taxpayer....hypocracy.",6_147_2
its showing.,6_147_3
Dustin Russell Look son...,6_148_1
Your attempt to change the subject is noted.However there is one question and one question only at play here.Do you approve of the angry terrorist that stormed the Capitol on Jan 6th?Yes or no?,6_148_2
"Craig Turner Nftg I didn't approve of the left terrorist actions all summer, dont approve of what happened on the 6th either.",6_149_1
"See, I disapprove of all of it, not just the part that might get me 15 seconds of keyboard fame,  such as yourself.",6_149_2
"Dustin Russell ah yes, the way they attacked the building in Portland totally was the same as interfering in trying to finish the election of the President.",6_150_1
Your whataboutism is showing,6_150_2
"Chris Callicoat chose your agenda, but in the end, its the same.",6_151_1
You can't sit there and condone domestic terrorism in the name of BLM and then turn around and say that what happened on Jan 6th was worse.,6_151_2
Terrorism is terrorism.,6_151_3
There is no good terrorism and bad terrorism.,6_151_4
"Dustin Russell Actually, everyone protesting with BLM called out the people using the protest as cover for crime sprees.",6_152_1
I suspect you already know that.,6_152_2
But when you’re trying to justify a fascist coup against your own government you have to use whatever ammo you can find.Even if it’s just diversionary,6_152_3
Dustin Russell that you don't understand the difference says everything we need to know.,6_153_1
"Craig Turner Nftg have you noticed that those at the forefront of the ""coupare actually left leaning or extreme leftist?",6_154_1
"I would assume you knew that already though, as you are a scholar in this...",6_154_2
Give it up dude.,6_155_1
You sound like a tape recording stuck on stupid.,6_155_2
Craig Turner Nftg its all good.,6_156_1
I would be upset too if I found out my party had been caught leading this one too.,6_156_2
Dustin Russell So that’s the best conspiracy theory you guys can muster now?Wow.,6_157_1

"Them, they, these nuts, etc.",6_160_1
How do you know what they read or if they are able?,6_160_2
Most of them don't read books.,6_161_1
We need to do something about the people generating propaganda who do read books.,6_161_2
The books aren't the problem.,6_161_3
Widespread racist propaganda IS.,6_161_4
"“We need to do something about the people generating propaganda.” Full stop.Social media, talk show hosts, “influencers”, and other such non-IRL interactions — not necessarily books — appear to be largely accountable for the modern mass spread of delusions.",6_162_1

the Turner Diaries are what inspired Tim McVey so this is nothing new,6_170_1
It was one of Timothy McVey's favorite books,6_171_1
William Cloud McVeigh...,6_172_1
Yeah I caught that after I posted it but decided him unworthy of the time to change it.,6_173_1
But you are correct history should be properly remembered,6_173_2
Censoring books is wrong.,6_174_1
People should be able to freely discuss the ideas in those books n the marketplace of ideas.,6_174_2
Trying to remove them from the shelves will only increase the resentment of those who believe in free speech.,6_174_3
"Just like most books they claim to have read, they miss the main themes.",6_175_1
now banning books?,6_176_1
but To Kill a Mockingbird is banned  in many libraries / bookstores around the country -,6_177_1
"Mac EnTosh um, where?",6_178_1
Where?,6_179_1
"I know it used to be, but where is it still banned?",6_179_2
"Erin Marie  One case  occurred in 2018 at schools in Duluth, Minnesota, where copies of both To Kill a Mockingbird and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn were removed from the classroom.",6_180_1
"Unlike the previous case, the book was banned due to the accumulation of complaints over the years.",6_180_2
"n 2017, To Kill a Mockingbird was removed mid-lesson from 8th grade classrooms in Biloxi, Mississippi, over complaints about language in the book, in particular the use of the N-word.",6_181_1
Mac EnTosh those aren’t libraries or bookstores those are schools and two locations does not at all mean around the country.,6_182_1
It’s messed up yeah real messed up but facts matter especially as we watch a portion of our country continually fall for misinformation,6_182_2

"Kathy Matson No ma’am, this book is truly vile and contains a lot of language and ideas that would be very insulting to people of color, women, Catholics, Jews, etc.",6_192_1
It also contains graphic sexual violence and torture.,6_192_2
I stand corrected.,6_193_1

Hello everyone!,89_0_0
We are super excited to announce the 2021 Legacy Debate Camp!,89_0_1
"This summer, we will be holding two sessions.",89_0_2
"Week one will be held from August 2nd to 6th and week two, which will be a topic prep week, will be held from August 9th 13th.",89_0_3
"Due to the uncertainty of COVID-19, we have decided to commit to an online platform to ensure the safety and peace of mind of our students, staff, and parents.",89_0_4
"Below are a few things that make Legacy worth your while, particularly in relation to other summer programs.",89_0_5
Schedule: Below you will find an attachment of our outline for the summer schedule.,89_0_6
We’ve worked to try to develop a curriculum that emphasizes student freedom while maintaining the ability to establish relationships with staff and other students the will help students establish a strong footing in the activity.,89_0_7
"Some of you may be unfamiliar, so I thought I’d outline our vision for what you can expect to get out of your time with us.",89_0_8
"First and foremost - all of the “lecture,” “drill groups,” and “lecture w/drills” slots will be totally chosen by you!",89_0_9
"For each slot, we will have a selection of different options in each of the main areas of debate (including Ks, Philosophy/Framework, T/Theory, LARP, and general strategy) and will have a designated scale to indicate experience level (beginner, intermediate, and advanced).",89_0_10
This will allow student to have total control over what they learn during camp.,89_0_11
"We recognize that some students may be unsure what is best for them, which is why have our “advisor” program.",89_0_12
Each student will be assigned a staff advisor that will be in communication with you throughout camp to assist you with selecting lectures and drills that match your interests and experience to ensure you maximize your time.,89_0_13
The second week of lecture/drill sessions will be focused on how to apply certain positions or strategies to the topic.,89_0_14
"Second, we will have some lab time - primarily for establishing relationships and learning material we find to be essential for success beyond your selections.",89_0_15
This will work quite similarly to how most of you are familiar with what labs are at most camps.,89_0_16
"Third, projects groups will be implemented in the topic prep section of camp.",89_0_17
The topics of these project groups will also be selected by the students.,89_0_18
"The goal here is for staff to help you write, frontline, and strategize whatever position or type of position you are most interested in reading and have a jump start on well-crafted strategies for the topic.",89_0_19
Finally – office hours.,89_0_20
"We have realized that office hours are one of the best times during camp for students, so we have designated a good portion of the day for them.",89_0_21
You’ll be able to sign up for any staff member and can work on whatever you’d like.,89_0_22
"These slots will be 30 minutes each and, depending on student sign ups, you will be able to sign up for 2-4 sessions with different staff members per day.",89_0_23
"Staff: While we are still working on finalizing our staff list this summer, Legacy is most interested in hiring staff members that are equipped to be skilled instructors.",89_0_24
"While most institutions make their hiring decisions mostly on bid count or competitive success, that is only one factor in the hiring process – we aim to hire staff members with specialized and diverse knowledge bases, strong characters, and those with a passion for working with students.",89_0_25
Pricing: We’ve done extensive market research to ensure you get the most out of your camp experience for your money.,89_0_26
"For a standard online camp, one week of is around $1,000.",89_0_27
"For competitive topic prep sessions, the approximate cost is $800 for roughly half the time you’ll spend with us.",89_0_28
"At Legacy, our first week costs $600, with the topic prep session costing $800.",89_0_29
"Our entire two-week program prices out at only $1,250.",89_0_30
"Thus, by registering for our entire camp experience, you will receive the same amount of coaching for about half the price.",89_0_31
We also offer several scholarship opportunities for those that indicate a need for them.,89_0_32
"We will be following this announcement with special offers, details about camp, and more!",89_0_33
We are very much looking forward to a repeat of the success of last year.,89_0_34
